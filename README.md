    Copy the AudioVisualizer.js file into your React project.

Usage

    import React from 'react';
    import AudioVisualizer from './path-to-AudioVisualizer';

function App() {
  return (

      <h1>Your Music Visualizer</h1>
      <AudioVisualizer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

Features

    Real-time Audio Visualization: The component uses Three.js to create a 3D visualization that responds to the audio playing through the speakers.

    Dynamic Interaction: The visualizer adapts to changes in the music's tempo, volume, and frequencies, providing an engaging experience.

Props

The AudioVisualizer component can accept the following optional props:

    color: Customize the color scheme of the visualizer.

jsx

import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import AudioVisualizer from './path-to-AudioVisualizer';
import MyMusicPlayer from './path-to-YourMusicPlayer';

function App() {
  const audioRef = useRef();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Your Music Visualizer</h1>
      <MyMusicPlayer audioRef={audioRef} />
      <AudioVisualizer audioData={audioRef.current} />
    </div>
  );
